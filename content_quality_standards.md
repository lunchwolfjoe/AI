# Training Content Quality Standards

## 1. Narrative Style
- Every module must begin with a compelling, business-relevant story or scenario.
- Concepts should be introduced with analogies, real-world examples, and clear explanationsâ€”not just lists or definitions.
- The tone should be engaging, professional, and accessible to executive and business audiences.

## 2. Depth & Clarity
- Each section must provide context: explain not just "what" and "how," but also "why" it matters for enterprise outcomes.
- Avoid jargon unless it is clearly defined.
- Use step-by-step explanations for complex ideas.

## 3. Real-World Context
- Every major concept should be illustrated with a real-world business case, story, or analogy.
- Examples should be relevant to enterprise, leadership, or cross-functional teams.

## 4. Transitions
- Smoothly guide the learner from concept to application.
- Each exercise or assessment should be clearly motivated by the preceding narrative.

## 5. Exercises & Application
- Include scenario-based, practical exercises for each major concept.
- Provide clear instructions, time estimates, and success criteria for each exercise.
- Where possible, include sample solutions or rubrics for self-evaluation.

## 6. Assessments
- Each module must end with a knowledge check (quiz) and a practical challenge.
- Quiz questions should test both conceptual understanding and practical application.
- Practical challenges should be scenario-based and relevant to real business needs.

## 7. Executive Framing
- Emphasize the business value, risks, and strategic impact of each topic.
- Highlight how the skills learned can drive organizational outcomes.

## 8. Continuous Improvement
- All modules should be reviewed against this checklist before release.
- Feedback and lessons learned from each cohort should be used to update and improve content.

## 9. Narrative Depth Over Bullet Points
- Avoid bullet points and short lists for core content. All concepts, examples, and explanations should be written in full sentences and paragraphs, not just listed.
- Bullet points may be used sparingly for rubrics, checklists, or step-by-step instructions, but never as a substitute for narrative explanation.
- Each section should read as a cohesive, informative narrative, ensuring the learner receives context, depth, and actionable insight.
